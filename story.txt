The Illustrated Man
By Ray Bradbury
This sci-fi story combines two reoccurring themes in Bradbury’s work: children's capacity for cruelty, and the insidious potential of technology. Originally titled “The World the Children Made,” the story follows a family with two children who live in an automated house called “The Happylife Home,” designed to anticipate their every need.

The children are increasingly transfixed by their nursery, a virtual reality room that transforms to meet their whims. When the virtual reality nursery begins to assume the appearance of an African veldt, complete with bloody battles between carnivores and their prey, the parents grow understandably unsettled. Concerned by the violence of the world their children imagine in the nursery, the parents plan for the family to take a vacation away from The Happylife Home—but before they leave, the children want one last visit to the brutal world of their imagination.
